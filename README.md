# DS4200 HW3

The root directory of this repo contains the portfolio site deployed to GH pages [here](https://mehallhm.github.io/ds4200-hw3/) while part 2 of the assignment is contained in the `d3-plots` directory.

## Site Customizations

The site has many customizations, including 2 custom fonts (Poppins for the normal text and Kablammo for the headers and links, the later one being animated), custom colored backgrounds for two of the pages and an image bckground for the home page. In addition, there are custom margins and padding on nearly every element to help with the site's flow and structure. On the home page, the background has a slight blur effect where the text overlaps the image, with slight round edges. All the hyperlinks animated when hovered to provide user feedback that they are being selected. There is also a cool svg image of the Native American god of mischeif which fit the site's vibe quite well.
